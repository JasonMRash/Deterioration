 # Deterioration

A text based survival game where your goal is to find a cold war era bunker to survive.  Every move you make increases your radiation poisoning.  If you get to 100% radiation poisoning you die.

V1.0 - Created in 1 week for the Final Project of my 2nd Comp Sci class.

V1.1 - Made the game text easier to read by getting rid of old text on the screen, so the player does not have to figure out where the game left off after inputting a choice.
